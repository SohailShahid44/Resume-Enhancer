# Resume Enhancer
The job application process has become highly automated, with most companies using Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to filter resumes.  Many job seekers struggle to get their resumes noticed due to poor formatting, lack of relevant keywords, or not being tailored to the job description.  To solve this problem, this project introduces an AI-powered Resume Analyzer and Generator using LangChain, Gemini Model Flash 2.0, and Faiss DB.  The system aims to assist job seekers by evaluating their resumes, providing feedback, and generating application materials tailored to job postings.
