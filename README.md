# Resume Enhancer

# Introduction :

The job application process has become highly automated, with most companies using Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to filter resumes.

Many job seekers struggle to get their resumes noticed due to poor formatting, lack of relevant keywords, or not being tailored to the job description.

To solve this problem, this project introduces an AI-powered Resume Analyzer and Generator using LangChain, Gemini Model Flash 2.0, and Faiss DB.

The system aims to assist job seekers by evaluating their resumes, providing feedback, and generating application materials tailored to job postings.

# Problem Statment : 

Job seekers often fail to make it past ATS filters due to:
Poorly structured or non-ATS-compliant resumes.
Lack of optimization based on job descriptions.
Weak cover letters or no cover letters.
Limited guidance on resume improvements and interview preparation.
Manual customization for each job application is time-consuming and inefficient.

# Objective: 

Build an intelligent system that:
Analyzes resumes for ATS compatibility.
Calculates the ATS score based on a specific job description.
Identifies weaknesses and strengths in a resume and suggests improvements.
Generates professional and customized cover letters and resumes.
Assists users with interview preparation and job search using LinkedIn and Google.
